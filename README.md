# Get Version Run Number

A GitHub Action which extracts the version from `github.ref`.

Finally, you can reliably get the pushed version on every platform.

## Outputs

The pushed version. If `github.ref` was `/refs/tags/release/v2.6` or `refs/tags/2.6` then the value of this output will be `2.6.24`.
